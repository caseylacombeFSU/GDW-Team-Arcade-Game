Ship Escape is a two-player co-op puzzle platformer.  Assist your partner in navigating through doors and around obstacles as you both make your way to the escape pod at the top of the ship.

Controls:
Joysticks for movement (horizontal only)
Space or the 4 button to jump

Activate buttons to open doors for your partner, then navagate through the level avoiding hazards and making jumps

Interestind design features:
The system for how we have the buttons interact with their cooresponding doors and using that system the workaround we have for the two buttons at the end for the win condition
The modular design approach we took to designing the level using set prefabs for each game object in the level

All assets used were created by us or were unity primatives
